# Typing Game in React

This is a game I built following the React Bootcamp on Scrimba. I learned about React Hooks in the module I built this game. In the game itself I used useEffect, useState, and useRef.

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
